## Overview

TidyTuesday is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. Every week, a new dataset is posted, and participants create visualizations and share their work on social media. This repository contains my submissions for the weekly TidyTuesday Project, created using R and ggplot2.

## About TidyTuesday

The TidyTuesday project is:

- A safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data wrangling and visualization skills
- A weekly social data project that focuses on understanding data
- An opportunity to work with real-world datasets and create compelling visualizations

## Key Features

- **Weekly Visualizations**: Regular contributions exploring diverse datasets
- **R & ggplot2**: All visualizations created using R's powerful ggplot2 package
- **Data Storytelling**: Each visualization tells a unique story about the data
- **Reproducible Code**: All code is available for learning and reproduction
