## Overview

{delgosha} is an R package that aims to provide a collection of ggplot2 themes specifically designed for Right-to-Left (RTL) languages, with a primary focus on Persian (Farsi). This package makes it easier for R users to create beautiful, publication-ready visualizations in Persian and other RTL languages.

## The Challenge

Creating data visualizations in RTL languages like Persian, Arabic, or Hebrew presents unique challenges:

- Font support and rendering
- Text alignment and direction
- Label positioning
- Theme compatibility with RTL text

## Solution

{delgosha} provides:

- **RTL-Compatible Themes**: Pre-configured ggplot2 themes optimized for RTL languages
- **Font Management**: Easy integration with Persian fonts
- **Helper Functions**: Utilities to simplify working with RTL text in ggplot2
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive examples in both English and Persian

## Key Features

::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-6}
**For Users**
- Ready-to-use themes
- Simple API
- Persian font integration
- Example gallery
:::

::: {.g-col-6}
**For Developers**
- Clean, documented code
- Extensible architecture
- Unit tests
- CI/CD pipeline

## Technologies Used

- **R**: Package development
- **ggplot2**: Visualization framework
- **roxygen2**: Documentation
- **testthat**: Testing framework
- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous integration

## Package Philosophy

The name "delgosha" (دلگشا) means "heartwarming" or "delightful" in Persian, reflecting the package's goal to make data visualization in Persian a delightful experience rather than a frustrating one.

## Installation

```r
# Install from GitHub
