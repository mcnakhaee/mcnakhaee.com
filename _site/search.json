    "text": "Two weeks ago, I made a visualization that shows how Covid-19 cases spread in the Netherlands from the beginning of March and how grim the situation looked. However, someone pointed out the fact that the number of tests has increased significantly. It means that my plot may exaggerate the Covid-19 situation in the Netherlands. Unfortunately, I could not find testing data for each Dutch municipality. Instead, I decided to use hospitalization admissions and deceased cases to see if we can indeed see a massive spread in the second wave of Covid-19 cases in the Netherlands.\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(CoronaWatchNL)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(gganimate)\nlibrary(santoku)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(foreign)\ntheme_set(theme_void())\ntheme_update(\n  #plot.background = element_rect(fill = '#FDF6E3',color = '#FDF6E3'),\n  text = element_text(family = 'Poppins Light'),\n  plot.subtitle = element_text(\n    family = 'Poppins Light',\n    size = 10,\n    margin = margin(b = 10)\n  ),\n  plot.title = element_text(\n    family = 'Poppins Light',\n    size = 12,\n    margin = margin(t = 10, b = 10)\n  )\n)\nI created an R package called CoronaWatchNL that allows you to access a wide range of Covid-19 datasets.

    "text": "Aside from their political differences, Donald Trump and Barack Obama have very contrasting personalities, traits, and characters. Obama is known to be a great communicator and an articulate speaker whose speeches are used in English classes to show how one should speak proper English. On the other hand, Trump is not the most eloquent English speaker or US president in history. Every now and then, you can find a clip on the web where Donald Trump is being mocked for the way he speaks or mispronounces words. This is so obvious that even non-native English speakers can notice how Trump’s speeches are very simple and inarticulate. Of course, this was not a bad thing for Trump at all. Actually, almost every political analyst that you see on the news talks about the fact that a vast majority of Trump’s fervent supporters are not college-educated Americans. We can attribute this to the fact that he knows how to speak to his audience and his base supporters using their language (although it is more likely that he cannot speak English better than this level).\nThis post will investigate how difficult it is to understand what each US politician talked about in the 2020 US Election cycle. I will use several readability metrics that can help us compute text comprehensibility. A wide range of these measures are implemented in the {textstat} Python package, and it is super easy to calculate them using this package.\nI compiled a list of US Election-related speeches from rev.com and turned them into an R package called {us2020election}. I use this package as my data source for my analysis. Like some of my other posts, I use Python to perform the analysis and R to visualize my results. Now let’s get started by importing the necessary packages.\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(reticulate)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(us2020election)\nlibrary(ggridges)\ntheme_set(theme_tufte())\ntheme_update(legend.position = 'none',\n          text = element_text(family = 'Lobster'),\n          plot.title = element_text(margin = margin(t= 10,b= 5),family = 'Lobster'),\n          plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(b= 10),family = 'Lobster'),\n          panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#FDF6E3'),\n          plot.background = element_rect(fill = '#FDF6E3'))\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd \nimport textstat\nThere are several readability measures for English text included in {textstat}. Calculating these measures is very straightforward and easy. I will explain what each metric represents in more detail.\nCode\nus_election_speeches = r.us_election_speeches\nus_election_speeches['Flesch_Reading_Ease_formula'] = us_election_speeches['text'].apply(lambda x: textstat.flesch_reading_ease(x))\nus_election_speeches['gunning_fog'] = us_election_speeches['text'].apply(lambda x: textstat.gunning_fog(x))\nus_election_speeches['smog_index'] = us_election_speeches['text'].apply(lambda x: textstat.smog_index(x))\nus_election_speeches['automated_readability_index'] = us_election_speeches['text'].apply(lambda x: textstat.automated_readability_index(x))\nus_election_speeches['coleman_liau_index'] = us_election_speeches['text'].apply(lambda x: textstat.coleman_liau_index(x))\nus_election_speeches['linsear_write_formula'] = us_election_speeches['text'].apply(lambda x: textstat.linsear_write_formula(x))\nus_election_speeches['dale_chall_readability_score'] = us_election_speeches['text'].apply(lambda x: textstat.dale_chall_readability_score(x))\nus_election_speeches['text_standard'] = us_election_speeches['text'].apply(lambda x: textstat.text_standard(x))\nus_election_speeches['text_standard_float'] = us_election_speeches['text'].apply(lambda x: textstat.text_standard(x,float_output  = True))\nLet’s look at the resulting dataframe.\nCode\nus_election_speeches &lt;- py$us_election_speeches \nus_election_speeches %&gt;% \nglimpse()\nNow I am going to visualize the changes in the distribution of speech complexity for each politician. To make things easier, I will select a list of politicians that I’d like to analyze in this post.\nCode\nspeakers &lt;- c('Barack Obama','Pete Buttigieg','Mike Pence','Elizabeth Warren','Bernie Sanders','Donald Trump','Kamala Harris','Joe Biden','Mike Bloomberg')\ncustom_palette &lt;-c(\n    'Mike Bloomberg' = '#4E79A7',\n    'Amy Klobuchar' = '#4E79A7',\n    'Joe Biden' = '#4E79A7',\n    'Pete Buttigieg' = '#4E79A7',\n    'Elizabeth Warren' =  '#4E79A7',\n    'Barack Obama'  = '#4E79A7',\n    'Bernie Sanders' = '#4E79A7',\n    'Kamala Harris' = '#4E79A7',\n    'Donald Trump'  = '#E15759' ,\n     'Mike Pence' = '#E15759' \n  )\nAlso, I created a function to make ridge plots for each metric easier.\nCode\ncreate_plot &lt;- function(metric = Flesch_Reading_Ease_formula,subtitle = subtitle) {\n  metrics &lt;- rlang::enquo(metric)\n  us_election_speeches %&gt;%\n    separate_rows(speaker, sep = ',') %&gt;%\n    filter(speaker %in% speakers, type != 'Debate') %&gt;%\n    add_count(speaker) %&gt;%\n    ggplot() +\n    geom_density_ridges(aes(\n      x = !!metrics ,\n      y = speaker,\n      fill = speaker\n    )) +\n    labs(x = '', y = '',title = \"How Easy Is It to Comprehend Different US Politicians?\",subtitle = str_wrap(subtitle,width = 100)) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = custom_palette) \n}\nNow, let’s look at several readability measures in more depth."
