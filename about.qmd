## {{< fa solid user >}} Hello, I'm Muhammad Chenariyan Nakhaee

I'm originally from Iran but I live and work in the Netherlands since 2018. I've had different roles in the world of data including researcher, data scientist, and data engineer.
But I'm currently an AI Engineer working for a Dutch company. 
I mostly use Python for my day-to-day job but my true passion is creating data visualizations and R.
**Also known as:** Muhammad Nakhaee, Muhammad C. Nakhaee

## {{< fa solid briefcase >}} What I Do
In the past few years, I have realized that I enjoy exploring my creative side and making different things.
My true passion is creating charts and graphs (which is why I started this blog).
I also enjoy photography and have a collection of old cameras that I use for my photography.

I have worked on various projects in the data world, from machine learning, AI, and data engineering to data visualization. In my current job, I am an AI engineer working on our RAG solutions and developing agents.
