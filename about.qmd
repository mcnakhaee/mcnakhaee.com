## {{< fa solid user >}} Hello, I'm Muhammad Chenariyan Nakhaee

I've had different roles in the world of data including researcher, data scientist, and data engineer.
But I'm currently an AI Engineer working for a Dutch company. 
I mostly use Python for my day-to-day job but my true passion is creating data visualizations and R.

In my current job I'm a kind of an AI engineer working on our RAG solutions and developing agents. But my true passion is creating charts and graphs (hence why this blog was started)
